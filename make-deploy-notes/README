makedeploynotes.py
==================

Fetches the changes between two wmf/ branches, formats for mediawiki.org
changelog and prints that to stdout.

Usage:

    makedeploynotes.py oldversion newversion

Example:

    # print the changes
    makedeploynotes.py 1.35.0-wmf.18 1.35.0-wmf.19

Notes:
    symlinks to mwrelease because python doesn't allow importing a package
    from a parent directory.

    TODO: refactor so that the filesystem hierarchy is more python-compatible
